This is a python script that modifies your host files to block/unblock websites specified in the Blocked Sites list
When you want to unblock sites, it requires you to write a 100 character explanation for why you want sites to be unblocked. 
This entry is saved on your local computer in a file called unblock-request-journal.txt.

The normal version has these options:

1. Block social media
2. Unblock social media

The timed version has these options:

1. Block social media
2. Unblock social media
3. Unblock sites for 20 minutes

Note: Option 3 is my favorite! Leave it running in the terminal and it will show your countdown timer '10 minute warning', etc. After 20 minutes, your open browsers will be abruptly CLOSED so the site blocks can go into effect.
